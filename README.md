Hi, this project is practice project to start learning the python library 'pygame'. I'm using this tutorial to guide me through pygame "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w&t=6409s".

In this project I have created a game, it is inspired by the old classic game Space Invaders, but I have changed all the sprites to give it a different type of feel from the original one.

This project might not be perfect, but it could improve by the help of open sourcing, if you have any tips or ways to improve my project feel free to fork it and send me a push request. I will try to implement as many features as possible
